## Stories
* As a talented individual I want a website to demonstrate my abilities.

## Discussion
You should use a Mock JSON data structure to drive your application.  You can put any fields in there that are valuable to you right now.  Once you have your JSON data mocked out on the front end, building out the server side part should be easier.
